# bourbaki-lean
Slow, mainly for fun formalization of the Bourbaki books in Lean 4 from pretty much scratch (no mathlib, only the standard library).
# Build
Use [[lake](https://github.com/leanprover/lake)]. `lake -Kdoc=yes build LeanBourbaki:docs` builds both the library and docs.
# Contribute
i don't think you should, honestly
